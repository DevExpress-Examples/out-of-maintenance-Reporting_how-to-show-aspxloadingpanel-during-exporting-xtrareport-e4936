# How to show ASPxLoadingPanel during exporting XtraReport


<p>This example demonstrates how to show a loading panel while a document of an exported report is being created on the server side.</p><p>When an exported document is large, it takes several seconds to export it, and you might want to show ASPxLoadingPanel during exporting. The main issue is that a document should be exported on a full page postback and written to the server response, and it is impossible to show APSxLoadingPanel during a full page postback. </p><br />
<p>The main idea of this approach is to perform exported document generation on a page callback, save the resulting document in the server memory, and after that perform a full page postback just to get a generated document from memory and write it to the Response. </p><br />
<p>As document generation is processed on a callback, it is possible to display a loading panel while a callback is being processed.</p><p><strong>See also:</strong><br />
